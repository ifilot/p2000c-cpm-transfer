# Zork I, II, III ("zork123")

**Zork** is one of the earliest and most iconic text adventure games, originally
developed by members of MIT's Dynamic Modeling Group in the late 1970s. The
trilogy — **Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III** — was later commercialized by
**Infocom** and released on a wide range of platforms, including **CP/M**.

These games are fully text-based, running in a terminal-style interface, and
challenge players to explore an underground empire filled with puzzles, traps,
treasures, and memorable locations like the Great Underground Empire, Flood
Control Dam #3, and the infamous Maze of Twisty Little Passages.
